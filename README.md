# Alpha
Alpha Version of Ball Parkour 1.

# Outline 
I first started a project based off of one of the Unity Units adding concepts from other Unit's to it and meshing them together but once I re-read the brief on the 25th I realized what I was doing I would get 0 for so I had to start a new project. I took my original project Idea of well a ball rolling around on ramps like a lot of games you see. The Alpha is the best it could be in the time due to my own lack of reading and understanding the brief. I also chose to do the project myself, I had a partner but we couldn't work together so I made the decision to split off and do the project myself. I am reapeating 50% of year 2 modules and I have to do well in all of them to move into next year. Hopefully you understand.
